Create a markdown file on your own GitHub repository (private, inviting me).
In this markdown, provide a short description of your approach to solve the problem.
List your source code, and the result of at least one example per approach, along with the contents of the files you used.
Discuss the the hurdles and benefits of developing each approach, and how did you handle them (I'd suggest to keep track of this in a diary-based approach).


Approach used to solve:
As I read the problem statement it seemed like a big problem and also since there are two different parts of the algorithm to be implemented, I first though of using module the solution
like what ever I am gone write should be modularised and clearly use lot of funtions.
